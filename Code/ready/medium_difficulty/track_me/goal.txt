here is a malware sample which was found
on one of our machines, can you help us to track the attacker
who sent this to us?
we'd need the IP address of the attacker.

NOTE: as this is just a little experiment, this malware
does not do anything "bad" to your machine, so you can
run it without a need to setup a virtual machine / sandbox
for it.
